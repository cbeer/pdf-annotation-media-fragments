# PDF.js, Annotations, and Media Fragments

This is a proof-of-concept integration of [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js), the [OKNF Annotator](https://github.com/okfn/annotator) widget, and a [Media Fragments](https://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/)-based audio player for rich media annotations within a PDF.
